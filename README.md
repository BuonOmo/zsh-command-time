# zsh-command-time

It tells you roughly how long was your last command, without cluttering your shell.

## Installation

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Configuration

There is not much to do, just get the information and be glad. If the 5 second
default threshold is not suitable for your need, you can set it to another value by setting the `COMMAND_TIME_THRESHOLD` variable.

## Aknowledgement

Even though this is a project on its own, most of the ideas come from other original authors.

- Sindre Sorhus and the _refined_ theme for the base idea.
- the zsh-autosuggestions project for the backbone.
